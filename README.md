Hi there, I'm Greg. This is my personal site and blog.

**Project Status: In Development (next-gen branch)**

This repository is currently being rebuilt from scratch with a new Next.js architecture. The previous implementation has been removed, and content has been preserved during the migration.

## Current State

This project is in transition:
- **Content preserved**: All blog posts and media are available in `content/`
- **Framework**: Preparing for new Next.js implementation
- **Branch**: Development happening on `next-gen` branch

## Content Structure

- `content/posts/` - Markdown blog posts with frontmatter
- `content/media/` - Images and media files for posts
- Blog posts migrated from previous Hexo-based implementation

## Development Status

Currently awaiting integration of new Next.js theme and markdown processing system. The content directory serves as the source of truth for all blog posts and will be integrated with the new static site generator.
