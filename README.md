Hi there, I'm Greg. This my personal site, created using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)â€”a nice javascript/node static site generator. Enjoy!

## [How to Install and Configure OpenVPN](https://cardoni.net/how-to-install-and-configure-openvpn/)

#### Published: Nov 13, 2014

First I realized that [DigitalOcean][digital_ocean]'s so-called "private networking" wasn't truly private ( see: any box in their NYC3-datacenter can see all traffic over the private `eth1` interface on their VMs ). Then I wrote this article on how to install and configure OpenVPN ( on any unix server ) and layer a secure network on top of an insecure one, enabling one a new, virtual `tun0` interface over which secure communication is afforded between machines on the same local network. Boom.

## [Getting Started With Git](https://cardoni.net/how-to-use-git-with-personal-projects/)

#### Published: Feb 29, 2012

I published this article when I first started to enjoy using `git` for version control. Now you can learn from my mistakes and come to understand and utilize `git` like a champ. ( I'd like to add some additional git-related articles in the future. Keep an eye out for that: #4 )
