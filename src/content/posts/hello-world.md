# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog built with Next.js! This is a sample post to demonstrate how markdown content is rendered.

## Features of This Blog

- **Next.js** - A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering
- **Markdown Support** - Write content in markdown format
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling with utility classes
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Vercel Deployment** - Easy deployment with Vercel

## Code Example

```javascript
// Example code block
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write more about:

1. Web development
2. JavaScript and TypeScript
3. React and Next.js
4. And much more!

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
