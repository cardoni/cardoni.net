Deploying your Rails 3 app to [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") (on their _[Cedar](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar "Heroku Cedar Stack for Rails 3 Apps")_ stack)?

### Protip
Don't forget to run this commandâ€”ya know, just as you would when first running the app locally on your own machine.
(Might save you 20 minutes of chin-scratching!)

```bash
# Run a rake task on Heroku:
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

#### Good times!
